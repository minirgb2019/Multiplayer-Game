# Multiplayer-Game
  This is for a dot connected multiplayer game by using Html and Javascript.
  I have client side code from the company, so I was thinking to use React to work on the server side codes, but I found to use Live Server is the best solution.
  I use Visual Studio Code to edit codes, so I serched the Liver Server in the Visual Studio Code and installed the Live Server. I right click on the mouse, then I click on "Open With Live Server." The html shows on the website by Live Server. Any change on the codes shows on the website.
  I played dot connected game. It can show player1 and player2.

#Improvement
  It might use React to rewrite codes, which can make multiplayer game, so players can interact better.
  It might add some 3-D floating image on the website.
